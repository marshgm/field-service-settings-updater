# Field Service Resource Updater

Bulk-update Field Service **Bookable Resource** settings across many resources at once — set Start/End Location, Organizational Unit, Display on Schedule Board, Enable for Availability Search, Hourly Rate and Time Off Approval; apply work hours by weekly pattern or by copying another resource's calendar; and quick add/remove skills (characteristics) and territories for everyone selected. Preview every change before applying.

By Mark Christie.

One self-contained HTML app runs in three hosts:

- **Power Platform ToolBox (PPTB)** — dark theme, via `window.dataverseAPI`.
- **XrmToolBox** — Windows 95 theme, hosted in a WebView2 plugin.
- **Dynamics 365 web resource** — light theme, same-origin `fetch`.

## What it does

Pick a set of bookable resources (Users by default), tick the settings you want to change, preview, and apply across the whole selection.

### Bookable Resource fields (bulk set)

| Setting | Column | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start Location | `msdyn_startlocation` | Choice (Resource Address / Org Unit Address / Location Agnostic) |
| End Location | `msdyn_endlocation` | Choice (same options) |
| Organizational Unit | `msdyn_organizationalunit` | Lookup → `msdyn_organizationalunit` |
| Display on Schedule Board | `msdyn_displayonscheduleboard` | Yes/No |
| Enable for Availability Search | `msdyn_displayonscheduleassistant` | Yes/No |
| Hourly Rate | `msdyn_hourlyrate` | Number |
| Time Off Approval Required | `msdyn_timeoffapprovalrequired` | Yes/No |

Only ticked settings are written; everything else is left untouched.

**Location readiness checks.** Start/End Location are validated before you apply:

- **Location Agnostic** must be set on *both* Start and End, or neither (Field Service rejects a mismatch) — checked per resource, and a contradictory pair blocks Apply.
- **Resource Address** needs a geocoded address on the resource's related User/Contact/Account record. The grid's **Address** column shows `✓ geo` / `no geo` / `⚠ none` per resource, and the preview warns how many selected resources aren't ready.
- **Organizational Unit Address** needs the org unit to have an address — org units with none are flagged `⚠ no address` in the Organizational Unit dropdown, and the preview warns if selected resources would use one (or have no org unit).

### Work hours

A resource's work hours are a **calendar** (recurring rules), not a column, so the tool uses the Field Service work-hour calendar APIs (`msdyn_SaveCalendar` / `msdyn_DeleteCalendar` / `msdyn_LoadCalendars`). Two modes:

- **Weekly pattern** — choose working days + start/end times, an optional daily break, capacity and time zone. Applied as a weekly recurrence to every selected resource.
- **Copy from a resource** — pick one resource as the source; the tool reads its calendar for a representative week and recreates that weekly pattern (working hours + breaks, in UTC) on every selected resource. Irregular per-date overrides on the source are not copied.

Tick **Clear existing work hours first** to remove current rules before writing the new pattern (recommended for a predictable result).

### Quick actions — skills & territories

- **Skill (characteristic)** — add a characteristic to everyone selected (optionally with a rating value), or remove it. Backed by `bookableresourcecharacteristic`.
- **Territory** — add everyone selected to a territory, or remove them. Backed by `msdyn_resourceterritory`.

Add is idempotent (resources that already have the skill/territory are skipped). Remove asks you to click twice to confirm.

## Using it

### Power Platform ToolBox

1. Install from the Tool Registry, or load locally via the Debug Menu after `npm run build`.
2. Open the tool, pick a connection, **Load resources**, choose settings, **Preview**, then **Apply to selected**.

### XrmToolBox

1. Install from the Tool Library (search "Field Service Resource Updater"), or build and run `xrmtoolbox/install.ps1`.
2. Connect with an **OAuth/MFA** connection (the WebView2 host forwards that bearer token to the Web API).
3. Open the tool from the Tools list.

### Dynamics 365 web resource

Upload `field-service-settings-updater.html` as an HTML web resource; it authenticates with the signed-in session.

## Build

```
npm run build          # copies the single-file app + icon into dist/ and the XTB app/ folder
npx pptb-validate      # validate the PPTB manifest before publishing
```

For the XrmToolBox plugin:

```
cd xrmtoolbox
node make-icons.js                              # (re)generate tile icons + logo.png
cd FieldServiceSettingsUpdater
dotnet build -c Release
..\install.ps1                                  # copy dll + app into the XrmToolBox Plugins folder
```

## Notes & limits

- **Permissions** — applying changes requires write access to Bookable Resource and the related tables, plus the OwnCalendar privilege for editing a User-type resource's calendar.
- **No automatic undo** — preview shows exactly what will change; review before applying. Work-hours "clear first" deletes existing calendar rules.
- **Copy work hours** reconstructs a *weekly* pattern from one sample week, so standard recurring schedules copy faithfully; one-off date exceptions do not.
